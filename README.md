# french orthographe
a quick n dirty cheatsheet to french orthography

### Intended usage
- You wanna know what you're doing when encountering French words in the wild but you don't actually want to commit to learning French (yet). Understandable.
- You are not a linguist who does this for fun anyway by reading the orthography pages of languages on Wikipedia. You're just a regular person.
- You don't need to sound perfect. You don't need to actually sound like you are fluent in French. You just want to not sound like a dum-dum.
- You know English and hopefully some Mandarin (with Pinyin) too. (The two reference languages for explaining pronunciations in this guide.)

!!! IF YOU ACTUALLY KNOW FRENCH PLEASE BE AWARE THAT THIS GUIDE SIMPLIFIES MANY EXPLANATIONS AND GLOSSES OVER EXCEPTIONS. NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR ACTUALLY STUDYING FRENCH. !!!

## Vowel sounds
| French vowel | IPA | EN or ZH approximant | Examples in French | Notes |
|--------------|-----|----------------------|-------------|-------|
| a, à, â      |/a/, /ɑ/| EN: **ah**, ZH: **a** | **a**r**a**ble,  déj**à**, ch**â**teau           |       |
| ai, aî, aie  | /ɛ/ |  EN: **eh** as in m**eh**| m**ai**s, s**ai**son, ch**aî**ne      |
| aï           | /a.i/|  EN: **ah** followed by **ee**  |   n**aï**f          | in French, a diaeresis over a vowel usually means to pronounce the vowel as a separate sound. e.g. read aï as "a" then "i" rather than the single sound "ai"      |
| au, eau, o      |/o/ |EN: **oh**               | h**au**te, ch**au**d, b**eau**, m**o**t, ch**o**se |   |
| e, ê, ei, è     | /ɛ/ | EN: **eh** as in m**eh**  | chal**e**t, **e**xam**e**n, for**ê**t, t**ê**te, n**ei**ge, r**ei**ne, rel**è**ve | in many monosyllabic words like l**e**s or n**e**z,  it is pronounced like é (see below) but many non-native speakers don't differentiate and it's fine you will be understood |
| e          | 	/ə/ | EN: **a** as in Tin**a** (pronounced casually, like "uh"), ZH: **e** as in s**e**  | qu**e**, d**e**, l**e**, j**e**, p**e**tit | |
|é          | /e/ | ZH: **ei** as in l**ei** but slightly softer | id**ée**, cl**é** | again, don't worry if you pronounce this the same as the "eh" e above or vice-versa |
| eu        | /ø/, /œ/ | EN: **u** as in p**u**t | p**eu**, b**eu**rre, d**eu**x  |  |
| i, y         | /i/    | EN: **ea** as in **ea**t, ZH: **yi**  | pet**i**t, c**y**clone  |    |
| œ         | /œ/, 	/ø/     | ZH: **eu** in ch**eu**ng as in 'long' in Cantonese.. |  **œ**il, s**œu**r, **œ**uf | don't worry if you can't differentiate this from "eu" |
| oi, oie, oî     |  /wa/     |   ZH: **ua** as in h**ua**  | **oi**seau, m**oi**, cr**oi**x, bes**oi**n |   |
| ou, oue, où, oû    | /u/ |    ZH: **wu**   |     t**ou**t, c**ou**ture, a**oû**t   | |
|  oy       |  /waj/ |  EN: **wah** followed by a **y** sound leading to the next vowel | m**oy**en  | so moyen is pronounced like "mwah-yen" NOT "moh-yen". if you forget you can pronounce like how you would normally read "oy" in english. |
| u, û, üe       | /y/ | ZH: **v** as in n**v** (woman) |  t**u**, b**u**t, fl**û**te | technically different from "ou" but it's ok if you can't differentiate them |
|  uy       |  /ɥij/ | EN: kiiinda like **wee** ... | br**uy**ant, gr**uy**ère | you can think of it like taking the "u" sound above and adding an English "ee" sound then a "y" sound leading to the next vowel |

### Tips on diacritics (accents)
- Accent marks in French do not drastically change the pronunciation of a vowel. If you cannot differentiate è and é, people will just think you have a cute Anglo accent.
- For many native speakers of French (can depend on dialect) certain diacritics like the circumflex (the hat) do not change the pronunciation at all.
- As mentioned above, the diaeresis (two dots) accent usually indicates that a vowel should be pronounced separately and distinctly, rather as part of a blended vowel. 

## Consonant sounds

### Unintuitive consonants
- **ill** is pronounced like regular French "i" following by a "y" sound. *E.g. b**ill**et, maqu**ill**age*
- **ge** is soft like French "j". *E.g. **gé**nial, maquilla**ge***
- **gu** is hard like English "g". *E.g. **gu**erre, va**gu**e*
- **qu** is usually simply "k", not "kw" like English. *E.g. **qu**otidien*
- **th** is pronounced like "t"
- **h** is always silent

### Silent consonants
If the word ends in a consonant, the consonant is often (but not always) silent or not pronounced as expected. (Loanwords are often obvious exceptions.)
- **-s** and **-x** indicating plurals are silent. *E.g. le**s**, eau**x**, oiseau**x***
- **-m** is often pronounced like **-n** when final. *E.g. fai**m***, parfu**m**
- **-er** is sometimes pronounced with a silent "r" (more likly for verbs and adjectives) *E.g. all**er**, premi**er*** 
- **-t** is frequently silent in the final position, especially as part of **-ent**. *E.g. ven**t**, tan**t***
